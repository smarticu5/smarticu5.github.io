## Generic Conference Speaker Bio

Iain Smart is a Principal Consultant at ControlPlane, where he reviews cloud-native deployments and performs offensive security engagements. He enjoys playing with new technologies, and if he's not hacking a Kubernetes cluster or attacking a build pipeline he can probably be found writing new home automations to annoy his family.
