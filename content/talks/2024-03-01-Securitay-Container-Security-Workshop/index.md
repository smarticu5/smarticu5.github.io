Presented at [Securi-Tay 2024](https://www.securi-tay.co.uk/)

An introduction to container security, delivered alongside [Rory McCune](https://raesene.github.io). We touched on most of the basics of Docker and Kubernetes security, but due to time constraints this course was even more rapid than our delivery at [SteelCon](/talks/Steelcon-Container-Security-Workshop/)
