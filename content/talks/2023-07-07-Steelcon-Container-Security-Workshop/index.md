Presented at [Steelcon 2023](https://www.steelcon.info/)

An introduction to container security, delivered alongside [Rory McCune](https://raesene.github.io). We touched on most of the basics of Docker and Kubernetes security, but obviously this topic is far too big to cover in 4 hours. 

Slides linked below, but the infrastructure is no longer live. The infrastructure is built through IaC (Terraform and Ansible) and would probably be a good blog post on it's own one day. We used Rancher to provide a central cluster for students, and made heavy use [KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io) for individual exercises.
