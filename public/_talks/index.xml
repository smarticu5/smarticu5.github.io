      <description>Presented at Steelcon 2023
An introduction to container security, delivered alongside Rory McCune. We touched on most of the basics of Docker and Kubernetes security, but obviously this topic is far too big to cover in 4 hours.
Slides linked below, but the infrastructure is no longer live. The infrastructure is built through IaC (Terraform and Ansible) and would probably be a good blog post on it&amp;rsquo;s own one day. We used Rancher to provide a central cluster for students, and made heavy use KinD for individual exercises.</description>
