      <description>Originally posted by NCC Group at https://research.nccgroup.com/2023/04/17/public-report-kubernetes-1-24-security-audit/
NCC Group was selected to perform a security evaluation of Kubernetes 1.24.0 release in response to Kubernetes SIG Securityâ€™s Third-Party Security Audit Request for Proposals. The testing portion of the audit took place in May and June 2022. The global project team performed a security architectural design review that resulted in the identification of findings in terms of secure design of Kubernetes. The team also performed dynamic native application pen tests, including source code and cryptographic review which found vulnerabilities in multiple components.</description>

      <description>Originally posted by NCC Group at https://research.nccgroup.com/2022/01/13/10-real-world-stories-of-how-weve-compromised-ci-cd-pipelines/ with multiple authors.
Mainstream appreciation for cyberattacks targeting continuous integration and continuous delivery/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines has been gaining momentum. Attackers and defenders increasingly understand that build pipelines are highly-privileged targets with a substantial attack surface.
But what are the potential weak points in a CI/CD pipeline? What does this type of attack look like in practice? NCC Group has found many attack paths through different security assessments that could have led to a compromised CI/CD pipeline in enterprises large and small.</description>

      <description>Generic Conference Speaker Bio Iain Smart is a Principal Consultant at ControlPlane, where he reviews cloud-native deployments and performs offensive security engagements. He enjoys playing with new technologies, and if he&amp;rsquo;s not hacking a Kubernetes cluster or attacking a build pipeline he can probably be found writing new home automations to annoy his family.</description>
